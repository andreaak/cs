	* Lib/Constants.cs: Add a handful of extra contants.

	* Lib/Codec.cs: Put here the coding/encoding routines that were
	originally in egit's lib/Constants.java class

	* Lib/*: Align some API doc comments, add some API docs.

	* Lib/RefDatabase.cs (Peel): Implement.

	* Lib/Constants.cs: Put all the constants here (not sure where
	some new constants should have gone). 

	* Lib/Ref.cs: Update to support `Peeled' property and
	`OriginalName' from newer eGits.

	* test.cs: make the sample program dump all the refs.

	* Lib/Repository.cs: Expose GetAllRefs.

	* Lib/RefDatabase.cs (ReadOneLooseRef): Do not crash if the
	refName is not present in the looseKeys.

	(RefreshPackedRefs): If the packed-refs file does not exist, do
	not try to continue, it would otherwise crash.

	* Lib/WindowedFile.cs: Implement another file from the original
	Java implementation.

	* Lib/PackIndex.cs: Fix indentation of comment.

	* Lib/WindowCursor.cs: Implement.

	* Lib/ByteArrayWindow.cs: Implement the functionality for
	ByteArrayWindow, do not derive from ByteWindow which is a design
	in the original Java implementation to use two different backends
	for storage.

	We could achieve the same in a cleaner way than the original
	implementation if we choose to do so using an interface.
